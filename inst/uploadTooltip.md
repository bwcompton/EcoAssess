Use **Upload** to upload a polygon shapefile (or other common formats,
such as KML or geoJSON) designating your target area

Note that you'll need to 
prepare the shapefile in GIS software---it should include only the target area;
uploading parcel data for an entire town won't do

When uploading shapefiles, you'll have to select (or drag) the multiple files
comprising the shapefile, at a minimum, **.shp**, **.shx**, and **.prj**
