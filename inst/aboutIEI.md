The Index of Ecological Integrity (IEI), is a product of the Conservation Assessment and Prioritization System (CAPS), an ecosystem-based approach for assessing the ecological integrity of land and water and subsequently identifying and prioritizing areas for habitat and biodiversity conservation. It has been used by conservation practitioners for over 15 years to target areas for protection as a component of strategic land conservation.

The CAPS analysis was applied to 13 states in the northeastern United States using The Nature Conservancy's Ecological Systems Map, 
which delineates ecological systems such as various types of forests or wetlands. We added streams and various classes of 
developed land and roads. The model evaluates two dozen landscape metrics for every point in the landscape, assessing effects 
such as microclimatic alterations associated with "edge effects," intensity of road traffic in the vicinity, the inflow of 
road salt to aquatic ecosystems, or the effects of human development on landscape connectivity. These metrics are combined 
separately for each ecological system into an Index of Ecological Integrity, which scores each point in the landscape 
relative to all other points in the same system.

IEI is scaled four ways: regionally, such that each point is compared with others in the same ecolocical system across the 
entire northeast, as well as by state, ecoregion, and watershed. These latter scalings can be useful when working in 
relatively developed areas where regional IEI is low.

Funding for development and application of CAPS has been provided by U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, the USGS Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, 
Massachusetts Department of Fish and Game, The Nature Conservancy, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under section 104 (b)(3) of the U.S. Clean Water Act, the Federal Highway Administration via a grant administered by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, Massachusetts Office of Energy and 
Environmental Affairs, Massachusetts Audubon Society, and 
The Trustees of Reservations. Coastal metrics were developed in collaboration with the 
Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management.
