Use **Upload** to upload a polygon shapefile designating your project area

Note that you'll need to 
prepare the shapefile in GIS software---it should include only the project area;
uploading parcel data for an entire town won't do

All polygons in your shapefile will be treated as a single project

When uploading shapefiles, you'll have to select (or drag) the multiple files
comprising the shapefile---at a minimum, **.shp**, **.shx**, and **.prj**

Alternatively, upload a .zip file that inclues your shapefile
