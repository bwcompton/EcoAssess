**Core**. The _Index of Ecological Integrity_ (IEI), is an assessment of ecological integrity---the ability of a site to support 
biodiversity and ecosystem processes over the long term, based on landscape models combining several integrity metrics. IEI is 
estimated at four scales, ranking each site within the entire northeastern United States (Regional), its state (State), its 
TNC terrestrial ecoregion (Ecoregion), and its HUC 6 watershed (Watershed). IEI is scaled from 0.01 to 1.0 in percentiles for 
all cells each ecological system. Reported scores are the mean IEI for the project area.

**Connect**. _ecoConnect_ provides a multi-scale, ecosystem-based estimate of regional connectivity throughout the Northeast. ecoConnect is 
independent of pre-defined conservation cores, connecting points with high IEI throughout the landscape based on ecological 
setting, development, roads, and bridges. For a given ecosystem, it gives a measure of each site's contribution to regional 
connectivity. ecoConnect is scaled from 0 to 100 for each ecosystem group. Reported scores are the mean ecoConnect for the 
project area. https://umassdsl.org/data/ecoConnect
