This web tool provides access to landscape ecological models that estimate ecological integrity and
the contribution to regional connectivity of every location in the northeastern United States.
It is intended to help conservation practitioners strategically conserve land that supports viable 
ecosystems and wildlife populations. You can view Indices of Ecological Integrity (IEI) and ecoConnect across the
northeast or produce reports for designated target areas (e.g., parcels) summarizing IEI and ecoConnect.

The **center** pane displays maps of IEI and ecoConnect and provides tools for navigation
- drag the map to pan
- click **+** and **&#x2212;** to zoom, or use your mouse's scroll wheel
- type an address or location in the locate bar at the bottom right. This can be a full street address, the name of a town (for example "spruce creek pa"), or a latitude and longitude (for example, "42.3923, -72.3448")

The **right** pane allows selected layers to display and controls how they are displayed
- toggle Full screen to make more room for maps and panels
- click **>** to collapse the right panel, making more room for the map
- select one of the four scalings for the Index of Ecological Integrity (IEI), or one of the four
ecoConnect layers
- drag the ecoConnect scaling slider to the right to lighten lower-valued paths, emphasizing important
paths for regional connectivity
- drag the layer opacity slider to make the IEI or ecoConnect layers more transparent or more opaque
- turn off layers or set layer opacity to 0% to focus on the basemap
- select one of the three choices of basemap: *Map* - a plain map of roads and place names,
*Topo* - USGS topographic maps, or *Imagery* - aerial photographs from USGS

The **left** pane includes a tool for producing reports for specific sites (e.g., parcels) as well as links to documentation
- click **<** to collapse the panel
- click Draw to draw a polygon delineating your target area, or
- click Upload to upload a shapefile of your target area, and then
- click Get report. You'll have an opportunity to provide a project name and description, then you can download a PDF report to your computer.
- click Restart to clear drawn polygons or uploaded shapefiles and start over
